ML practice: KNN vs Logistic Regression — accuracy comparison
🔍 What I did:
- Trained a model with **Logistic Regression**  
- Trained a model with **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- Compared accuracy of both models  
- Trained KNN with different **k values** (neighbors)  
- Visualized accuracy vs k to find the best k value
 📊 Results:
- Logistic Regression accuracy: 81.3%  
- KNN accuracy (best k): 81.9%
